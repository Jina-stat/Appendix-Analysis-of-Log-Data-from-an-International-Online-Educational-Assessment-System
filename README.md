Due to the large number of trace plots generated for each country, we are unable to upload all plots directly to this repository.

Instead, we've made the full trace plot available via the following Dropbox link:

The archive contains the following directories:
- `multi-chain-cdtally`
- `prior-sensitivity-analysis-cdtally`
- `traceplot-cdtally`
- `traceplot-lampreturn`

Each directory includes trace plots and related materials used in the supplementary analysis for different modeling configurations.
